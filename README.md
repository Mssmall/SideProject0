Aware that coloured blue keys do not disappear if particular song stops playing.
    ->> update: changes keys to white when song finishes playing


What to implement next?

Would like to add volume, as well as a progress bar.
Ability to repeat, rewind and fast forward
Would also like to add a song counter - # of times a song is played.
Would also like to stop audio playing if another audio track is clicked.
Make the keys more realistic - when clicked, the keys push down like a real piano
How to add more variety - multiple songs per key, and each key a different genre?
Or maybe add real piano note sounds to make a proper keyboard
